            <span>Dude I am so heckin tired. I couldn't fall asleep yesterday and went to bed at like 5 AM and woke up to my alarm at 7:30. I took PTO till lunch and slept till around 10, and then worked out.
                Its kind of weird, but being really tired feels like I'm high, cuz I was jus doin the most random shit today. I feel like I like people more when I'm tired. Is that weird to say? OKay I can';t think
                right now, byby.
            </span>
