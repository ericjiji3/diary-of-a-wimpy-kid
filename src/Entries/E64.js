                Damn I woke up late today and went to work:/ My high ass got chick-fil-a at like 11 PM and that shit hit differerntly. After work I went to ball with our sister company Uncommon 
                Logic and saw Ben Liu from Mccombs Summer Institute classes!! It was cool catching up with him and I'm happy we both found something straight outta college. I also saw Dawit, who I've balled with before
                at Pease park. Its crazy cuz he works for UCL :OOO whatta small ass world. David also came to ball with his boi Chase but they only stayed for a game. Then I went back to David's crib and we bought Chicago
                tickets for LOLAPALOOZA BABEEEE. Blessed to be where I am right now:DDDDD
