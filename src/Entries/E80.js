                Happy cinco de mayo!! Our company had a party outside today with hackeysack and margs, and I had one too many cuz I was FADEDDD. We were supposed to go to work after the party, so 
                I sat down at my desk and my head was soooo dizzy I was just writing random shit on my notepad to look like I was busy. I eventually asked Matt if I could take PTO for the rest of the day 
                and he let meðŸ¤¢ I went back home and took a nap until the evening, then I went with Becca to a bar called Nickel City! I had a good ass time; we both like talking about deeper stuff, which 
                was pretty cool cuz I had some fulfilling convos with herðŸŽ¤ Then we went to a halal food truck and ate it on the 26 west rooftop and balled after, which was rlly nice:) She tried showing me sum 
                EDM, but i dont think that genre is for meðŸ¥´
