                Got Lunch with Gabriel today at La Centerra! I haven't talked to that man since like middle/high school, so it was really cool to reconnect with himðŸ¥°
                He's the same ol Gabe I remember gaming with when we were littleðŸ˜Œ I used to go over to his house all the time and I remember I would always have a blast
