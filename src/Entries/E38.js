            <h2></h2>
            <span>Theres a huge difference between reaction and response- unconscious vs conscious. If you live to react to others, you are a slave to other's opinions. Being able to consciously respond to others means that you reach into your 
                inner self rather than be driven by instant beliefs or biases. Reaction is to be emotional, response is to have emotional intelligence.
