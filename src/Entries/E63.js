                I went to jim, balled a lil bit, then I went to chill with Josue and Abbas and watch sum playoffs. I hope the people that I've met and became close to I'll stay close with throughout my life, but I know that's tough; 
                we all got our own lives to live and we're not always gonna be in the same area, but hey, I believe a real relationship transcends all of these things. Also, I'm super proud and happy for my mom and how she always keeps herself busy and makes
                time for friends! To know that she is constantly active and social really pushes me to do the same as well:) Love ya momma❤️
