                I went to jim, balled a lil bit, then I went to chill with Josue and Abbas and watch sum playoffs. I hope the people that I've met and became close to I'll stay close with throughout my life, but I know that's tough; 
                we all got our own lives to live and we're not always gonna be in the same area, but hey, I believe a true pure relationship transcends all of these things.
