                I think I admire people with a strong mind. I noticed that a couple of weeks ago, weed has been makin me a bit anxious;
                I was just too in my head and not grounded in the present. I also think I associated weed with negative connotations, so 
                as soon as I got high, I fell into these preconceived notions of how it would affect me. Recently, I've been just having fun 
                with weed and not taking it as seriously as I used to. ANWAYSSS I went to Abbas today cuz it was his last day in Austin before 
                he moved back to Houston for workðŸ˜¥ He made us borgers which were bussin bussin. Then we went to karaoke with David, Kyle, Vincent, and 
                some of their high school homies. Me and Nick dueted Out of Time BUT NO ONE KNEW THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT BANGER OF A SONG. Then we chilled 
                at Davids' a little and then Abbas took me home!!!!!!
