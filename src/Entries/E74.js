                I worked out today and then went to grab drinks wiht Rebecca, who was really cool! She's a biochem major, and actually likes it!
                She wants to go to grad school for biochem too, which could not be me bro my brain would overfry. She was easy to talk to and 
                we ended up going back to hers to smoke sum and talk more! She also got sum KRandB bangers that she put me on, which I've never really 
                been into.
