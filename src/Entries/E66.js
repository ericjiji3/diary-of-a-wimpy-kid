                Domeeiiiiiii I had a hectic ass day! My flight to NY was at 4 so I thot I had time to go to work for the first half of the day, but 
                I was wayyyy too baked yday to pack or anything. So I ended up taking PTO for the whole day so I could pack and get ready, BUT I STILL 
                HAD TO GET MY LAPTOP FROM THE OFFICE. After packing, Nick(thank u nick) gave me a ride with Brandon to the airport and I was like a hour ish early:D
                Good shit EricðŸ‘Š I chilled at a bar near my terminal and met this guy named Jake from Southern California! We took a shot together and couple brewskis which had me
                WASTED before my flight. Once I got on the flight I kinda passed out for most of it, then played a lil pokemon/smash towards the end of the flight. Then I talked with 
                this really cool dude named Angel who sat next to me. He was from the Dominican Republic and I loved how in the moment he lived. I could tell he had alotta love to give
                everyone. Don't be scared to talk to others; theyre probably thinking the same thing!
