            <span>I just got back to A town babeee. My mom is so precious and I had a good weekend with her. This morning, I hit with one of her friends and she was just really happy watching me which made me happy. We got some pho-cking pho and vermicilli from little V that shit was bussin.
                For some reason this whole weekend my insides have felt weird... like queesy idk how to describe it. I'm pretty sure I'm sad but it almost feels good to be sad. IDk its hard to describe. I think I'm sad because I realize I am alone, but at the same time it's kind of nice to be a true
                individual. Not only is being an individual kinda cool, but I like taking this time to I guess work on myself, no matter what kind of means of improvement I want. OK, imma go to Ryan's bday party rq. Gonna fukin smirnoff ice him >:)
