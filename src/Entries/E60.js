            <span>Went to the jim today and put my legs through emotional/physical turmoil. Then I had the time of my life in the saunda:DD Tbh, I just might start using it without working out
                 before, cuz it feels so good and peaceful. And then I finally hung out with Ming, Enrique, Sony, Eugene(I know thats not how you spell his name but FUCK I FORGOT HOW TO SPELL IT IT STARTS WITH A J THO), Danae, and Rebecca! 
                 We went downtown and barhopped a little bit, then we went to one of Danae's friends party and it was a bunch of fun! Good time with good people:)
