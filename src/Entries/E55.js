            <span>I went hiking this morning with Michelle at Brushy Creek Trail! It was super pretty and alotta fun, like her;)) We got Fat Dragon afterwards and they had sum pretty good dumplings.
                 I've never been much of a foodie, but I think its important to start looking out for and remembering places with good food. Food is something that all humans can relate to, which is why I think 
                 its such a strong form of communion. Not everyone smokes/drinks/likes doing certain things, but everyone likes food! I mean shiddd, we would be dead without it. After food, I went to Josue's to pregame
                 the Austin FC game with Arjun and Griffin. Now that shit was CRAZY. The stadium is pretty much brand new and we got really good seats close to the goal. Never really watched football, but I see why 
                 people like it now! I had a good ass time! Also it was so cool cuz the stadium would turn green whenever Austin FC scored a goal. I also gotta hat:)
