                I'm not sure if I'm gonna keep trying to log every day in this journal. Although I feel like its pretty cool to have a recount of all of my days, I have a hard time keeping upðŸ˜“ 
                Maybe I'm just being lazy tho lmfao. I feel like the more I write in this journal and have it out in the public, the more disengenuine some of my logs have been. I'm scared of what other 
                people think if I do have a bad day or thoughts, but why am I seeking approval from others? If I try to find my own happiness through the validation of others, how will I ever be truly happy if
                I can't be content with myself?
