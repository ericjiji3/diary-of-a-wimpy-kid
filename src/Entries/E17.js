            <span>It was thirsty Thursday at work today, and Andy waws really busy so he couldn't make anything this time. But JEFF CAME IN CLUTHC WITH A BUNCHA TRULYS AND BEER!! I had a few(ok mayb mmore than a few)
                and had a good time talking to my homies at work. Ive also been trying to make more of an effort of asking people to do things with me. Like Im gonna ball on Tuesdays and Thursdays with Abeer and Jeff(BRO OUR CEO) and I got lunch with Andy, Abeer, Genesis, Matt, and Matt. Im tired of always going with the flow and waiting for people to ask me to 
                do things. I realized as I get older that whether you hate it or love it, someone has to initiate if one wants to build a relationship. Stop standing around and waiting for life to pass you.
