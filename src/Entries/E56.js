            <span>Went to the gym today, and then worked on LMWW some. I respect da fuk outta Marcos/Jack for making such a detailed pricing sheet, it makes me believe in the company and want to make the website 
                as best as I can for them. Then I balled at the rooftop courts by myself, which was really nice. I needa go there more often. And thennnnn I chilled with Brandon a little bit:D
