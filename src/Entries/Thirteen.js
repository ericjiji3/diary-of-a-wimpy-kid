            <span>Fuck today is such a shitty day for no reason. I'm just in my feels 24/7. Why am I so fukin pudgy???? Why is it so hard to meet new people?? Everyone always thinks I have ill intentions, but 
                is it so hard to just have a conversation with someone and just enjoy being in the presence of them? Why can't I just give someone a hug, cuz I sure as hell want a hug. I just want to feel loved. To know that 
                its not only me in this stupid world. I want to believe that me projecting all my emotions onto this stupid website will help relieve some of these feelings, but I think its just an excuse for me to write out 
                my feelings and still be fukiin sad. 
            </span>
