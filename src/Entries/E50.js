            <span>I took PTO this morning even though I didn't need to at all. Like I probably got like 10+ hours of sleep, but these past couple of days
                I've just been going through it. I dont know what it is, but I keep feeling this existential dread of being alive as a young adult right now. Its like
                a combination of anxiety of how others are living, sadness that I will never truly be understood by anyone, and inner conflict on whether I feel the need to be alone or with somebody. 
                Or maybe I'm just cringe.
