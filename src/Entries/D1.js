            <span>Just a few more months till I graduate, and it feels like the scariest thing ever. I'm writing this down to hopefully organize my thoughts and vent out some of my inner frustrations.</span>
            <h3>INNER FRUSTRATION 1: DRUGS</h3>
            <span className="mb-3">Not that I really try other drugs besides weed, but the frequency is what bothers me. I used to smoke because it was a novel feeling. Now at times it feels like a necessity; 
                if I am not doing anything, weed would be my solution to my boredom. I don't think its a bad thing to smoke, but I should do it in moderation.
            </span>
            <h3>INNER FRUSTRATION 2: WORK</h3>
            <span>I hate comparing myself to others but I realize I am always doing it. Every time I hear a friend receive a new job offer, I'm not proud of them; I <u>envy</u> them. This shouldn't be the way I think about things, but
            its hard to break from this cycle. Also, seeing my friends land software developer positions while I'm stil struggling to do mediumn leetcode questions makes me question my own skills. But are you doing anything about it? 
            Of course you're doing leetcode, but ask yourself: is it enough? Is this even something you want to do for the rest of your life?
            </span>
