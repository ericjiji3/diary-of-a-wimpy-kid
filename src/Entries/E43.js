            <span>I was HOOPIN HOOPIN today during lunch with Jeff. I've been having trouble keeping up on the 2v2 games to 15, but I think I finally got some of my endurance back. Matt said for every point I 
                scored, I'd have an extra 5 minutes of lunch. Too bad he was kidding, cuz I would've gone home after lunch >:) Also went to Jack and Gingers at the domain to chill with Chase Tiedke and his gf Kira, but didn't get
                to talk to them all that much.
