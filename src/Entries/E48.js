            <span>I went to Abbas and Josue's to watch the man the myth the legend cook steak for the 304805872 time. Also got to hang with Allen, David, Brandon, and Arjun. Mixing friend groups always takes a toll on me idk why. We went to one of Brandon's friends party afterwards as well, and I had a groovy time. I feel like I am destined to only be a friend to others. No one seems to take me seriously, but I can't even blame them; I don't
                even take myself seriously.
