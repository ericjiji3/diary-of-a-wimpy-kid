                HAPPY 420!!!! That's all I could think about at work too lmfao. What a day for humans to dedicate a whole ass holiday for; 
                all for a plant that makes you feel kinda funny. Wingstop was also advertising weed wings that "would taste like 4/20", but why tf
                would you want something to taste just like weed? But hey, maybe im just a h8r. Abbas, Blue, Josue, Arjun, and Juju came over after work 
                and we tried hotboxing my room. It didn't really work out lol but it was still a gr8 time.
