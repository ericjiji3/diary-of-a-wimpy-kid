                Lifes moving so fast right now, but I kinda like it. Ive been keepin myself pretty busy outside of work with Wally and AWGE websites. Ive also been applying for jobs in NYC, 
                and already got a few first round interviewsðŸ˜„ I needa look into apartments in the area as well!! My lease here in Austin ends in September, so I really only have 3 months to figure
                something outðŸ˜° I dont even really know if NYC is right for me but I have some gut feeling that I needa move outta Texas. I want to meet new people and change my environment up! I also know 
                that NYC will have hella opportunities I just needa have initiative and constantly be on the lookout. I know Im meant for something special, I think moving out of Texas is the start of it for me.
