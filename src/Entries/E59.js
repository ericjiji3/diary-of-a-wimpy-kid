                I went home and baked but I don't think it was a good idea cuz I got way too into my head. I tried playing some pickup at Pease and it just wasn't as fun for some 
                reason:/ I think I care too much about what other people think about me, but who gives a fuk?? Its your life bro, JUST DO IT! Everyones too worried about themselves to 
                really even pay any attention to you. Actin like the world revolves around u, BITCH STOP HAVIN SUCH AN EGO.
