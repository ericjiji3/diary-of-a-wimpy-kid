                I spent the first half of the day walking around NYC by myself cuz Rahul and Harsh were busy with work. People really weren't kidding when they said 
                New York moves fast! There's so much energy in this city and everyone on the streets seem to be focused on some certain goal. Going on this trip really made me realize that its 
                impossible to meet everyone(obviously lmfao). There's only so much time we have with others, and even less time to actually have a thoughtful conversation with a stranger. Like if I see someone 
                in a line for food, that time I have with that person seems to be so short; how can I actualy have a meaningful convseration with them after I spend the first couple minutes exchanging pleasantries("What's your name?", "Where are you from?", "What do you do for work?"), and next thing you know,
                our food is ready and we have other places to be? Life is werid man. Also got a tattoo from Yang, who was so unhinged lmfao. There are some people that I feel so comfortable around; maybe its the fact that he just said
                whatever, no matter how crazy it was, with such confidence. And then me and Rahul met up with Srikari, Ashwin, Sauman, and Fara from high school! It was so fulfilling to see them again, and have conversations with some of them that I didn't even really talk to in high school! I'm happy that they all seem to be doing well,
                and who woulda thought so many peeps from Katy Texas would be all the way out here!!! Then Rahul, Harsh, and I went out to Brooklyn to check out some of the bars.
