            <span>I had a really productive Saturday! Brandon and Nick went to Kerbey with da gang, but I kind of felt like doing my own thing. I hate thinking that I'm ditching/flaking on my friends, 
                but ever since I've been single, it feels nice to finally have some time to really be alone. I feel like thats how I learn the most about myself, as an individual. I went to Starbucks and worked 
                on LMWW(Las Muchachos World Wide) and Brandon's website, then I went to ball at Pease Park and ran into Genesis! They had this huge Squirrel Fest event with a bunch of vendors, but I just ended up
                playing 1v1 against another dude there. And then I went to buy some food from mah boi Ming, and chill with Abbas a little bit. Then I chilled with Greg, Arjun, Griffin, and Belle at our crib for a little.
