            <span>Isn't it crazy that someone important in your life can just disappear? Like one day your talking to them about your day and how much you care for them, and the next day
                its like ya'll are complete strangers. We become scared to communicate to avoid emotional turmoil. "Maybe things are better if we don't talk", "maybe the distance will help us grow",
                "maybe we just weren't meant for each other"- maybe these maybes are right. Its also crazy that your mind can make you have a bad day, even when nothing went wrong that day. Your thoughts that your'e 
                sad cascade onto one another, just making you even more sad. Its like a small sad snowball that keeps rolling down the hill, picking up little bits and pieces of snow that also feed into your original sad thoughts. 
                The solution? I guess the solution is to recognize that this snowball is full of shit that your mind up. Sometimes its impossible to not start making this snowball, but it doesn't mean the snowball is gonna hit you. Its just
                a stupiid snowball that you'll notice, and move on with your frickin life.
