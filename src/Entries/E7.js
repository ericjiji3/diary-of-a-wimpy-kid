            <h1>2.21.22</h1>
            <span>I forgot to journal on this day so Im actually doing it on 2.22.22, but who tf cares?? Not like anyones gonna actuly look at this right?? RIGHT??
                  Also I want to stay consistent with this, because I suck at staying consistent at things. I feel like I'll get 2000% invested in a project, and end up never working on it again after like a week lmfao. 
                  I worked out legs yday and I went to ball with Ryan, Josue, and Sheshu. We were kinda ballers though, cuz we could not cathc an L. Also, I feel like I really resonate wiht that 7 Habits book I had to read at work, especially about 
                  the emotional bank. Whenever you invest time/attention to someone else, this acts like a deposit in an actual bank, and that bank is the someone else. By investing in thier emotional bank, you build trust within the relationship. That's why
                  conversations seem to come easier to those that have high emotional bank deposits; you have already built that trust and become more comfortable wiht the person. Although I hate to see it like a black and white transaction, I think just acknowleding
                  that spending time with others is really important in building a relationship. You could be doing anything with that time, but you choose to spend it with them.
