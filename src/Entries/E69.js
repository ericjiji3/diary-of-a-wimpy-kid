                I woke up kinda early this morning cuz I was gonna meet up with Kristina at a soccer field on the pier by Hudson River! I came a hour late and she dipped but its fine cuz I brought Rahul's 
                deflated basketball to try to ball by some basketball courts nearby. I asked some random dude on the soccer field if they had a ball pump and they did, which was clutcchhhh. Man it was so pretty at the pier:))
                You could see everything in the city from there. Then I went to go eat at this Peruvian food joint that Harsh found wiht Rahul and Aakash, which was sooo fukin good. I got bottomless brunch as well, so I got a 
                lil lit lmfao. We then went to a broadway show called the Skin of our Teeth, but I couldn't find my fukin vaccine card photo, and ended up looking for it on my phone for like a good hour after the show started. 
                Eventually I was like fuck it and still tried going in, but a different person stopped me and asked for my vaccine card as well. I just told them that I def got vaxxed but couldn't find a photo. She then said it was okay
                as long as I had an email verifying an appointment, which took me like 2 seconds to find god dammit LMAO. Not gonna lie tho, the play was confusing as fuk, but it was cool to see the inside of the theatre. After the play
                we went to Central Park, which was actualy one of the prettiest parks I think I've ever been in. Then we met up with some of Harsh's friends, Allen and Andrew, and we just chilled back at the crib playing COD. I was exhausted asf
                socially and physically so I was pretty glad we ended up having a chill night.
