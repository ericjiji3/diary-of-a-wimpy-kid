            <span>I balled alot today again lmfao. I am so muthafukin sore though I need to start stretching or else Imma be limping around like an old man in my 20s. Caitlin also had her last day here at work:( It
                 was funny though cuz she found a smirnoff ice in her desk and she chugged it like a CHAMP. I didn't get a chance to get lunch with her today, but were gonna plan a potluck cuz shes gonna still be here in 
                 Austin:D Also, I think Imma start adding pics/videos into this journal so I have something to reference visually, and cuz I suck at taking pics. Then I got Kura and boba with Michelle! I had a good ass time; 
                 I think its crazy that you can meet new people in your life and be comfortable around them in such a short time. I guess thats just how fast life moves now!
