            <span>I went bouldering today with Nick and Sheshu. It was super fun but I was kinda hungover so I didn't really go too ham. And then we got
                ciders from Eastciders and it was so mf good. Oh and we got ramen crusted chicken tendies from this food truck. I asked the dude how he came up with the idea
                and he just looked at me and said "marijuana" HAHAHAHA. Anddd yeah thats prety much it. Feel sad cuz I'm lonely and don't feel wanted, but thats on me. I hate feeding
                into that negative energy but its so easy to.
