            <span>Got some BOMB ASS Mexican food with Sheshu and Rahul yesterday and reminised at our headass highschool days. The feeling of reminiscing over the best/worst times you've had with
                 people that have been in your life always feels realy good:) Also its nice catching up with old friends and seeing them grow, but some things seem to always stay the same:)) Today I hung out with Juju and we got kinda baked 
                 and watched some Ranking of Kings and ordered sum Papa John's. Shit is still mid compared to Dominos though;)
