                I went hiking with Michelle again at Lady Bird Lake! We walked all the way out to the boardwalk and chilled there for a lil and headed back to Look Noodle. Bruh shes got sum good eyes cuz I almost stepped on this baby turtle but she was 
                able to spot it! Sony was workin there again and I ended up trying the chicken teryaki bento box. Then we got sum boba from this place that opened up on Guad in place of the old Taco Bell and that shit was 
                advanced asf! They had self service machines and it was really clean and fast. Boba was pretty dank too, I got the creme bru le. Then whenever we were aboutta dip we ran into Ming and Enrique puttin in work on the bar that theyre building 
                for Look Poke. I hung out with them a lil and saw some of the new stuff they were able to get for the bar. I'm excited for them, cuz I know this stuff is pretty expensive, but they're resourcesful as FUK. And then I chilled with Josue and we 
                balled out at Pease.
