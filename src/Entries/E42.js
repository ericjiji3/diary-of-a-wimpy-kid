            <span>Dude I've been playing so much basketball recently. I love just being loose and being a kid again with other people. I wonder if thats why it was so easy making friends
                as a kid; no one was thinking too much, just str8 up vibin together. I have been in a rut tryna find new music tho:/ I just need to listen to my Spotify discover playlist but sometimes
                the songs on there are unbearable to listen to lmfao.
            </span>
