                Damn I passed out on Enriques bed last night and woke up pretty early to cute lil Baby. I went back to my apartment and worked on getting the rest of the pricing sheet up and running for LMWW. 
                And then i hit the jim and balled with Josue and David afterwards. Then we went to eat at Look Noodle and saw Sony there workgin! I got the curry chicken again. Then we watched some boxing/basketball games 
                at David's crib:D
