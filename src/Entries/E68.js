                This morning me and Harsh went to a Buffalo Exchange dollar sale. The line was pretty long, but I had a great time hangin out wiht Harsh:) He's from South Carolina and used to play lacrosse. He was easy to talk to and is a pretty outgoing dude. Rahul your'e lucky you got a cool ass roomate to 
                put up with ur bullshit;) I got 4 things from the thrift store which costed me a grand total of $4!! Then on our way back to the crib we stopped at a outdoor flea market which was hugeee. They were selling all sorts of stuff, and I was able to get a watch I liked for $40 even though he was initially 
                selling it for $80. Although I shoulda tried to get it for cheaper, cuz it wasn't in the best condidition, and the scrolling wheel thing that changes the time didn't work either lmfao. We got dinner with Harsh's cousin Aakash, who studies Anthropology and wants to go to grad school for medical anthropology,
                which is really fukin interesting. I could also tell that he was really passionate about it from the conversations we've had. Then we went out to barcade AND I MET SOME RANDOM DUDE THAT WENT TO CINCO RANCH HIGH SCHOOL!! His name was Ed and 
                he's in the military; he's been stationed in Japan for 3 years and then Germany, and now here. Such a small world dude.
