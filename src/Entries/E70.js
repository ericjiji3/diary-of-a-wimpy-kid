                I went to get bagels from this place called Bagels and Coffee and then NYC public library to work on some changes to Jeffrey's website. There was this cute girl I ran into 
                at both places, but I was too much of a wuss to talk to her!! I feel like the feeling of embarassment like being awkward and stuff feels alot more uncomfortable in the short term, but the 
                feeling of regret is a type of uncomfortable that lingers for longer.. thats why anything that I'm scared of doing, I should just do!!!!! Then I went to Chinatown and that place was HUGEE. 
                I saw a buncha old asians gambling in the park, and my dumbass took a video of them in the least discreet way possible lmfao. As soon as the dealer saw I was recording, he stopped dealing and 
                EVERYONE LOOKED AT ME. I almost shit myself, I just told them I wasn't from here in Chinese and they were cool with it. Then I balled with someone at the park for a little bit, and ended up getting 
                some pork/duck over rice for Michelle. Chinatown felt like a whole other country; there were so many outside vendors selling fruit and snacks, and you could tell the culture was strong. It made me happy:)
                I went back and had to catch my flight back to Austin so I said goodbye to Rahul and Harsh. Love ya Rahul❤️ Im happy your doing well in NYC and found friends like Harsh to help you in your life
                journey. I was so nervous I was gonna miss the plane but I got there on time! Also there were only 2 people in my row, so we had a lotta space to chill on the flight. Then Michelle picked me up from the airport!
                She was super clutch cuz my flight landed close to midnight, which was pretty fuggin late. Im thankful for all the good people in my life❤️
