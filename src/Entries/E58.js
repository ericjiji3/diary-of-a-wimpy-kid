            <span>I went to the gym today and worked out my titties. Using the sauna after working out is the best feeling ever; it feels like your being hugged by a really warm blanket. Plus, 
                I can just close my eyes and jam out to sum bangerz. Then me Nick and Brandon headed to Arjun/Daniels to break in the brand spankin new puffco. After that we got some Whataburger and I tried their
                Dr. Pepper milkshake, which did NOT dissapoint!!! Then I watched an ep of Abbot elementary with da bois. That show is gonna be da next Office.
